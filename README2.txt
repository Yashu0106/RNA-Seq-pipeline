# Other confusing points that lacked exposure to public explanation.

# Ensembl reference vs NCBI reference: 
# While the two (and most of other databases) sourced back to the same batch of data, they derived into using different names / IDs for the same gene of that same batch of data.
# To make the matter more complicated, different downstream gene annotation tools have different compatibilities with these databases. 
# For example, PANTHER seems to take Ensembl ID nicely; however, it does NOT recognize many NCBI entrez ID and NCBI gene symbol. DAVID recognizes NCBI entrez ID as default, DAVID does NOT recognize ensembl ID properly. 
# Choose your GO annotation and analysis tool first, then decide which database of reference you want to use. 


# Ensembl and NCBI use its own way of name gene and transcripts. Some tool may convert two types of gene ID, but NCBI and Ensembl annotation does not 100% match each other, if you try to convert between two databases, some ID WILL be lost during conversions. 
# It is best to use one type of gene database throughout your anaylysis.

# Ensembl explain: Chromosomes, scaffolds and contigs: 
# Genome assemblies are hierarchical. The shortest assembly components are contigs, which are sequences taken from individuals. Contigs are assembled into longer scaffolds, and scaffolds are assembled into chromosomes if there is sufficient mapping information. Many genome assemblies have only been assembled to the scaffold level.
#Scaffolds are classified in three ways:
# Placed scaffolds: the scaffolds have been placed within a chromosome.
# Unlocalised scaffolds: although the chromosome within which the scaffold occurs is known, the scaffold's position or orientation is not known.
# Unplaced scaffolds: it is not known which chromosome the scaffold belongs to.
# The relationship between contigs, scaffolds and chromosomes is defined in AGP files. # These files describe how assembled sequences (eg chromosomes) are compiled from their components (eg scaffolds). In Ensembl, they import contig-level DNA sequence into their core databases. They also import the AGP files for contig-to-scaffold, contig-to-chromosome, and scaffold-to-chromosome mappings. This allows them to generate scaffold and chromosome sequence on the fly by stitching the contigs sequences together as specified by the AGP files.

# Toplevel:
# For each genome assembly, we define the set of toplevel sequences. These are sequence regions in the genome assembly that are not a component of another sequence region. For example, when a genome is assembled into chromosomes, toplevel sequences will be chromosomes and any unlocalised or unplaced scaffolds. If a genome has only been assembled into scaffolds, then toplevel sequences are the full set of unlocalised and unplaced scaffolds.

# EST/Expressed sequence tag:
# Expressed Sequence Tags are small pieces of DNA sequence (usually 200 to 500 nucleotides long) that are generated by sequencing either one or both ends of an expressed gene. The idea is to sequence bits of DNA that represent genes expressed in certain cells, tissues, or organs from different organisms and use these "tags" to fish a gene out of a portion of chromosomal DNA by matching base pairs. The challenge associated with identifying genes from genomic sequences varies among organisms and is dependent upon genome size as well as the presence or absence of introns--the intervening DNA sequences interrupting the protein coding sequence of a gene.
# Once cDNA representing an expressed gene has been isolated, scientists can then sequence a few hundred nucleotides from either end of the molecule to create two different kinds of ESTs. Sequencing only the beginning portion of the cDNA produces what is called a 5' EST. A 5' EST, which is obtained from the portion of a transcript that usually codes for a protein. These regions tend to be conserved across species and do not change much within a gene family. Sequencing the ending portion of the cDNA molecule produces what is called a 3' EST. As these ESTs are generated from the 3' end of a transcript, they are likely to fall within non-coding, or untranslated regions (UTR), and therefore tend to exhibit less cross-species conservation than do coding sequences.
